## Introduction

I joined Code Institute's FREE code along for 5 days course.

- https://learn.codeinstitute.net/u/pramnora@yahoo.com

The course began on Monday/and, today, is now Wednesday; so, by Friday this course will be done;   
and, I should have obtained a certificate stating: 'beginning front end web developer'. 

After that one would have to pay for the full course...; because it's no longer FREE, anymore;  
(if one can't afford to pay...I think, it costs around 7 grand...; then, one can still apply to get funding if eligible).  

Anyway, my aim in creating this GitHub folder repository is to store the lessons we learned during each of 5 days of the course.
